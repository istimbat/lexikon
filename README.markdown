# Lexikon

An iPhone application to query and cache results from the online Lexin Swedish-English dictionary.

This is an application for me, Caleb Jaffa, to learn more about iPhone development and at the same time give me a handy tool to be able to translate Swedish words when I am out and about. I am an American that currently resides in Falun, Sweden.

## Status

Currently in the beginning stages of development

## Code Contributions

Lexikon is using [Gus Mueller](http://gusmueller.com/)'s [FMDB](http://gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2008/06/new_home_for_fmdb.html) adapter for managing talking with the SQLite database.
